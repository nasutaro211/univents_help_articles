Univents has a “follower” option,  
This feature is simple and it can be used as followed.

1. When user apply for your events on Univents, the user will follow your organization.
2. Then you can send an event notification emails to this follower directly from the next event.

The more events you organize in Univents, the more followers you will gain for your organization and also the more people you can approach.

One thing to keep in mind is that **you will not increase your followers unless participants don't apply to your event through Univents**
When spreading your events through LINE or Facebook **be sure to encourage participants to register for the events through Univents**

Users can also unfollow organizations, so they can only recieve the information they need and avoid unnecessary information.
