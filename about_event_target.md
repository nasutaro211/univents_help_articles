The "Event Audience" column is used to determine:

 - Whether it is displayed on the event list page for each university?
 - Do you want your event to be listed in the weekly mail?

 ### How to choose event audience
 #### Events for university students only
 Check this box to stop working adults registering for your events.
 Therefore, information will not be sent to Working adults through weekly mail.
 In addition, a column for “Occupation” will be added to the "event target" column on the event details page.
Example : Occupation - College Student

 #### Events for our university students only
 Check this box to target only the universities where your organization operates.
 Therefore, the event will no longer be displayed on the event list page of other nearby universities, but will be displayed only on the event list page of the university where the organization is active.
 Also, weekly emails will be sent only to users of the university.
