Univents allows users to take surveys when registering for an event.
 You can ask anything, such as "Do you need Halal food?" Or "What are you looking forward to?"
 ** In addition, the following information is gathered by default, so you do not need to create a survey.  **

 - Name
 - Country of origin (region)
 - University
 - Student classification (university students, graduate students, etc.)
 - Department

 ### Types of response form
 There are five types of answer forms that can be created at Univents.
You can also add any number of questions to your surveys.

 This form is used when you want the user's email address.  If the user has already registered with Univents, the email address will be filled in automatically.
 * Univents handles user information safely.  Therefore, it is not good to send the user's email address to the organization implicitly, so this mechanism is used.  Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
